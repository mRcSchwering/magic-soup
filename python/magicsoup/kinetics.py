class Kinetics:
    """
    Class holding logic for simulating protein work.
    Usually this class is instantiated automatically when initializing [World][magicsoup.world.World].
    You can access it on `world.kinetics`.

    Arguments:
        molecules: List of molecule species.
            They have to be in the same order as they are on `chemistry.molecules`.
        reactions: List of all possible reactions in this simulation as a list of tuples: `(substrates, products)`.
            All reactions are reversible and happen in both directions (left to right or vice versa).
        abs_temp: Absolute temperature in Kelvin will influence the free Gibbs energy calculation of reactions.
            Higher temperature will give the reaction quotient term higher importance.
        km_range: The range from which to sample Michaelis Menten constants for domains (in mM).
            They are sampled from a lognormal distribution, so all values must be > 0.
        vmax_range: The range from which to sample maximum velocities for domains (in mM/s).
            They are sampled from a lognormal distribution, so all values must be > 0.
        device: Device to use for tensors
            (see [pytorch CUDA semantics](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html)).
            This has to be the same device that is used by `world`.
        scalar_enc_size: Number of tokens that can be used to encode the scalars Vmax, Km, and sign.
            This should be the output of `max(genetics.one_codon_map.values())`.
        vector_enc_size: Number of tokens that can be used to encode the vectors for reactions and molecules.
            This should be the output of `max(genetics.two_codon_map.values())`.

    There are `c` cells, `p` proteins, `s` signals.
    Signals are basically molecule species, but we have to differentiate between intra- and extracellular molecule species.
    So, there are twice as many signals as molecule species.
    The order of molecule species is always the same as in `chemistry.molecules`.
    First, all intracellular molecule species are listed, then all extracellular.
    The order of cells is always the same as in `world.cell_genomes` and the order of proteins
    for every cell is always the same as the order of proteins in a cell object `cell.get_proteome(world=world)`.

    Attributes on this class describe cell parameters:

    - `Kmf`, `Kmb`, `Kmr` Affinities to all signals processed by each protein in each cell (c, p).
      There are affinities for (f)orward and (b)ackward reactions.
    - `Kmr` Affinity of each regulating signal for each protein and each cell (c, p, s).
    - `Vmax` Maximum velocities of every protein in every cell (c, p).
    - `E` Standard reaction Gibbs free energy of every protein in every cell (c, p).
    - `N` Stoichiometric number for every signal that is processed by each protein in every cell (c, p, s).
      Additionally, there are `Nf` and `Nb` which describe only forward and backward stoichiometric numbers.
      This is needed in addition to `N` to properly describe reactions that involve molecules
      which are not changed, _i.e._ where `n=0`.
    - `A` Allosteric modulation for each signal in every protein in every cell (c, p, s).
      The number represents the hill coefficient. Positive coefficients have an activating effect,
      negative have an inhibiting effect.

    The main method is [integrate_signals()][magicsoup.kinetics.Kinetics].
    When calling [enzymatic_activity()][magicsoup.world.World.enzymatic_activity], a matrix `X` of signals (c, s) is prepared
    and then [integrate_signals(X)][magicsoup.kinetics.Kinetics] is called.
    Updated signals are returned and [World][magicsoup.world.World] writes them back to `world.cell_molecules` and `world.molecule_map`.

    Another method, which ended up here, is [set_cell_params()][magicsoup.kinetics.Kinetics.set_cell_params]
    which reads proteomes and updates cell parameters accordingly.
    This is called whenever the proteomes of some cells changed.
    Currently, this is also the main performance bottleneck.

    When this class is initialized it generates the mappings from nucleotide sequences to domains by random sampling.
    These mappings are then used throughout the simulation.
    If you initialize this class again, these mappings will be different.
    Initializing [World][magicsoup.world.World] will also create one `Kinetics` instance. It is on `world.kinetics`.
    If you want to access nucleotide to domain mappings of your simulation, you should use `world.kinetics`.

    Note: All default values are based on the assumption that energies are in J, a time step represents 1s,
    and molecule numbers are in mM
    If you change the defaults, you need to reconsider how these numbers should be interpreted.

    The kinetics used here can never create negative molecule concentrations and make the reaction quotient move
    towards to equilibrium constant at all times.
    However, this simulation computes these things one step at a time
    (with the premise that one step should be something similar to 1s).
    This and the numerical limits of data types used here can create edge cases that need to be dealth with:
    reaction quotients overshooting the equilibrium state and negative concentrations.
    Both are caused by high $V_{max}$ with low $K_m$ values.

    If an enzyme is far away from its equilibrium state $K_e$ and substrate concentrations are far above $K_M$ it
    will progress its reaction at full speed $V_{max}$. This rate can be so high that, within one step, $Q$ surpasses
    $K_E$. In the next step it will move at full speed into the opposite direction, overshooting $K_E$ again, and so on.
    Reactions with high stoichiometric numbers are more prone to this as their rate functions are sharper.
    To combat this [integrate_signals()][magicsoup.kinetics.Kinetics] works by iteratively approaching
    $V_{max}$ on multiple levels of the computation.
    The approach was tuned to compute fast and give satifisfying reults with certain conditions in mind.
    $V_{max} \le 100$, $K_M \ge 0.01$, and concentrations $X$ generally not much higher than 100.
    Violating these assumptions could lead to reaction quotients constantly overshooting their equilibrium.
