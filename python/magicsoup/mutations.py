    Add point mutations to a list of nucleotide sequences.
    Mutations are substitutions and indels.

    Arguments:
        seqs: nucleotide sequences
        p: probability of a mutation per nucleotide
        p_indel: probability of any point mutation being an indel
                 (inverse probability of it being a substitution)
        p_del: probability of any indel being a deletion
               (inverse probability of it being an insertion)

    Returns:
        List of mutated sequences and their indices from `seqs`.

    The returned list only contains sequences which experienced at least one mutation.
    The new sequences are returned together with their `seqs` index.
    E.g. `("...", 5)` means `seqs[5]` was mutated and the resulting sequence is
    in the tuple.

    The returned list only contains sequence pairs that experienced a recombination.
