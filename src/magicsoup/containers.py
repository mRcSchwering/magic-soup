class Molecule:
    """
    Represents a molecule species which is part of the world, can diffuse, degrade,
    and be converted into other molecules.

    Arguments:
        name: Used to uniquely identify this molecule species.
        energy: Energy for 1 mol of this molecule species.
            This amount of energy is released if the molecule would be deconstructed.
            Energetically coupled in a protein it could power other activities.
        half_life: Half life of this molecule species in time steps.
            Molecules degrade by one step if you call `world.degrade_molecules()`.
            Must be > 0.0.
        diffusivity: A measure for how quick this molecule species diffuses over the molecule map during each time step.
            Molecules diffuse when calling `world.diffuse_molecules()`.
            0.0 would mean it doesn't diffuse at all.
            1.0 would mean it is spread out equally around its Moore's neighborhood within one time step.
        permeability: A measure for how quick this molecule species permeates cell membranes during each time step.
            Molecules permeate cell membranes when calling `world.diffuse_molecules()`.
            0.0 would mean it can't permeate cell membranes.
            1.0 would mean it spreads equally between cell and molecule map pixel within one time step.

    Each molecule species which is supposed to be unique should have a unique `name`.
    In fact, if you initialize a molecule with the same name multiple times,
    only one instance of this molecule will be created.

    ```
        atp = Molecule("ATP", 10)
        atp2 = Molecule("ATP", 10)
        assert atp is atp2
    ```

    This is used later on in the simulation to make efficient comparisons.
    It also allows you to define overlapping chemistries without creating multiple molecule instances of the same molecule species.

    However, this also means that if 2 molecules have the same name, other attributes like e.g. energy must also match:

    ```
        atp = Molecule("ATP", 10)
        Molecule("ATP", 20)  # raises error
    ```

    Molecule half life should represent the half life if the molecule is not actively deconstructed by a protein.
    Molecules degrade by one step whenever you call [degrade_molecules()][magicsoup.world.World.degrade_molecules].
    You can setup the simulation to always call [degrade_molecules()][magicsoup.world.World.degrade_molecules] whenever a time step is finished.
    You could define one time step to equal one second and then use the real half life value for your molecule species.

    Molecular diffusion in the 2D molecule map happens whenever you call [diffuse_molecules()][magicsoup.world.World.diffuse_molecules].
    The molecule map is `world.molecule_map`.
    It is a 3D tensor where dimension 0 represents all molecule species of the simulation.
    They are ordered in the same way the attribute `molecules` is ordered in the [Chemistry][magicsoup.containers.Chemistry] you defined.
    Dimension 1 represents x-positions and dimension 2 y-positions.
    Diffusion is implemented as a 2D convolution over the x-y tensor for each molecule species.
    This convolution has a 9x9 kernel.
    So, it alters the Moore's neighborhood of each pixel.
    How much of the center pixel's molecules are allowed to diffuse to the surrounding 8 pixels is defined by `diffusivity`.
    `diffusivity` is the ratio `a/b` when `a` is the amount of molecules diffusing to each of the 8 surrounding pixels,
    and `b` is the amount of molecules on the center pixel.
    Thus, `diffusivity=1.0` means all molecules of the center pixel are spread equally across the 9 pixels.

    Molecules permeating cell membranes also happens with [diffuse_molecules()][magicsoup.world.World.diffuse_molecules].
    Cell molecules are defined in `world.cell_molecules`.
    It is a 2D tensor where dimension 0 represents all cells and dimension 1 represents all molecule species.
    Again, molecule species are ordered in the same way the attribute `molecules` is ordered in the [Chemistry][magicsoup.containers.Chemistry] you defined.
    Dimension 0 always changes its length depedning on how cell replicate or die.
    The cell index (`cell.idx`) for any cell equals the index in `world.cell_molecules`.
    So, the amount of molecule species currently in cell with index 100 are defined in `world.cell_molecules[100]`.
    `permeability` defines how much molecules can permeate from `world.molecule_map` into `world.cell_molecules`.
    Each cell lives on a certain pixel with x- and y-position.
    And although there are already molecules on this pixel, the cell has its own molecules.
    You could imagine the cell as a bag of molecule hovering over the pixel.
    `permeability` allows molecules from that pixel in the molecule map to permeate into the cell that lives on that pixel (and vice versa).
    So e.g. if cell 100 lives on pixel 12, 450
    Molecules would be allowed to move from `world.molecule_map[:, 12, 450]` to `world.cell_molecules[100, :]`.
    Again, this happens separately for every molecule species depending on its `permeability` value.
    Specifically, `permeability` is the ratio of molecules that can permeate into the cell and the molecules that stay outside.
    Thus, a value of 1.0 means within one call half the molecules permeate into the cell.
    This permeation also happens the other way round, from inside the cell to the outside.
